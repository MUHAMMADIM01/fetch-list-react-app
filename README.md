🔍 What to Review:
I kindly request feedback on the following aspects of the project:

1. Code Quality and Structure:

Are my components modular and reusable enough?

Is my folder structure appropriate for a scalable React project?



2. Use of React Hooks:

Am I using useState and useEffect correctly?

Are there performance or logic issues in how I fetch and display data?



3. UI/UX Design:

Is the design accessible, readable, and user-friendly?

Any suggestions for improving layout, colors, or user feedback (loading/error states)?



4. Error and Loading Handling:

Does the app provide clear feedback when data is loading or errors occur?

Is there a better pattern to follow for asynchronous data fetching?
